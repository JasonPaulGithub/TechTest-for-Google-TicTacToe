a 48 hour coding challenge for a job at Google

This was a coding challenge from Google. It was sent to a recruiter who never got back to me. 
I would really appreciate feedback on my code. Thanks!

# Coding Task:

Given a huge Tic Tac Toe board find if any player is a winner. 

A winner is a player who has a full row, column or one of the 2 major diagonals. 

The board is always a square but of a large size (n x n, not just  3 x 3) ; it fits completely in memory
There are 2 players but the board may still have empty spaces where no player has played.
