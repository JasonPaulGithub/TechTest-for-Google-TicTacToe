# Coding Task:

Given a huge Tic Tac Toe board find if any player is a winner. A winner is a player who has a full row, column or one of the 2 major diagonals. 
The board is always a square but of a large size (n x n, not just  3 x 3) ; it fits completely in memory
There are 2 players but the board may still have empty spaces where no player has played.
